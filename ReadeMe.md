Imaginary Cities is a simple Unity 2019.2 C# project which allows you to generate procedurally generated cities
using a Perlin noise heightmap approach to choose the height of the buildings and to spawn nested grids for a street-grid
style layout.

The project is explained in this series of videos on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuldlT8dkudokn1FWfzFEiXF4aGTkyU9Z
